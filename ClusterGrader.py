#   n = number of front-view images
#   m = number of back-view images
# The quality is calculated as:
#   quality = max(n, m) / (n + m)

# contains mostly one type (front or back), while values near 0.5 indicate a mixed or less pure cluster.

# so larger clusters have more influence on the final result.
# The sum of all weighted qualities is then divided by the total number of images across all clusters.

# where q_i = purity of cluster i, and n_i = number of items in cluster i.
